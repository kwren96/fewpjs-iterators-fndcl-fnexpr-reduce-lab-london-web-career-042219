## Use `reduce()` to Create a Single Aggregate of All Items in a List.

Let's say we are hard at work in the battery factory. We've assembled several
batches of batteries today. Let's count how many assembled batteries we ended
up with.

* Create a new variable called `totalBatteries` which is the sum of all of the
battery amounts in the `batteryBatches` array. Naturally, use `reduce()` for this!

## Conclusion

With `reduce()`, like many other enumerators in the JavaScript library, we are able
to quickly get a minimized list or a total sum from a set of values, including values
that we might have filtered out of a list. With this, we can greatly cut down the
amount of time spent recreating common functionality, or building out helper methods
for commonly used functionality from scratch.
